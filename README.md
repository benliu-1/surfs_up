# Module 9 | Assignment - Surfs Up

## Overview of Project

## Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to summarize Oahu weather data in June & December to determine whether the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
- Oahu temperatures in June are very pleasant, with a minimum temperature of 64 and a maximum temperature of 85.
- Oahu temperatures in December are also very pleasant, but have a potential to be relatively cold with a minimum temperature of 56.
- The standard deviation for temperature is higher in December than in June, meaning there is a potential for wider swings in temperature in December.

## Summary
By studying Oahu's weather statistics for both June and December across multiple years, it is easy to see that Oahu is a very pleasant place to visit. The mean temperature in both months are fairly close (75.94 in June and 71.04 in December) compared to other regions in the contiguous United States, likely owing to Oahu's proximity to the equator. Although the weather may appear to be very enjoyable during both June and December, it would be interesting to run an additional query on precipation data for both months. If precipitation were much higher in one month compared to another, there would be less tourists visiting. It would also be interesting to see the precipitation data categorized by particular areas of Oahu, which would be determined by the latitude and longitude data. We could then hone in on the area where the surf shop would be located to determine whether precipitation is more or less of an issue in that area.
